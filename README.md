# reveal-audit

A secure, blockchain-powered health metrics tracking and auditing platform using Clarity smart contracts on Stacks, ensuring privacy, integrity, and controlled access to personal health information.

## Overview

Reveal Audit is an innovative health metrics platform built on the Stacks blockchain that provides:

- Immutable and secure health data storage
- Precise tracking and verification of personal health metrics
- Granular, permission-based data sharing
- Advanced data integrity and audit trail mechanisms
- Privacy-preserving health information management

## Smart Contract Architecture

The platform leverages blockchain technology to create a robust, secure health metrics ecosystem:

### health-metrics
A core contract designed to capture, validate, and manage individual health measurements with:
- Multi-dimensional health metric tracking
- Strict data validation and integrity checks
- Comprehensive audit trail capabilities
- Flexible data retrieval and historical analysis

### Key Features
- Support for multiple health measurement types
- Cryptographically secure data storage
- Fine-grained access control
- Transparent and immutable record-keeping

## Data Categories

The platform supports various health data categories:
- Vital Signs (heart rate, blood pressure, etc.)
- Lab Results
- Medications
- Medical History

## Permission Levels

Three levels of data access permissions:
- Read: View-only access to specific data
- Write: Ability to add new records
- Full: Complete access to manage data

## Getting Started

1. Deploy the smart contracts to the Stacks blockchain
2. Register users through the health-data-registry contract
3. Set up provider authorizations as needed
4. Configure vital tracking parameters
5. Define health alert thresholds

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data should be encrypted before storage
- Access permissions are time-bound by default
- Provider verification is required for data access
- Emergency access provisions are monitored and logged
- Regular security audits are recommended

## Usage Examples

### Register a New User
```clarity
(contract-call? .health-data-registry register-user)
```

### Record Vital Signs
```clarity
(contract-call? .vitals-tracker record-vital 
    VITAL-TYPE-HEART-RATE 
    u75  ;; heart rate value
    block-height 
    none ;; optional notes
)
```

### Grant Provider Access
```clarity
(contract-call? .provider-authorization grant-access 
    provider-principal 
    u86400  ;; duration in blocks
    "full"  ;; access level
    (list "vitals" "medications")  ;; data types
)
```

### Set Up Health Alert
```clarity
(contract-call? .health-alerts create-alert-threshold
    METRIC-HEART-RATE
    u100  ;; threshold value
    "gt"  ;; greater than
    SEVERITY-MEDIUM
)
```
